# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project utilised Third-party APIs, speicifically Open Weather Map API, to build a simple weather dashboard that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The application takes in a city input and generates a 5 Day Forecast, through the Open Weather 5 Day / 3 Hour API, for that location, inclusive of temp, windspeed, humidity and corresponding weather condition icons. Local storage was used to store persistent data, so a list of previously searched cities remain displayed on your screen.

The following animation displays the applications functionality:

## Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Overview
I found this a very challenging yet rewarding project. I struggled alot through Third Party APIs and Local Storage implemenetation, but the trial and error process has taught me a lot going forward. It's not my most aesthetic application and I would like to continue to improve it but the functionality was the primary goal in the completion of this project.
